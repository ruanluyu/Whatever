# Whatever
A happy game
To play with it, clone whole project into local disc.Then open project folder with eclipse IDE.Then run it!

*This game is developed on Processing 3 core and minim sound lib.If eclipse cannot detect them,it could be found among this path: Whatever->lib.Input them manually and load to your project build path.
Have fun~
